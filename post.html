                The climb started early in the morning. The air was crisp, and the roads were empty. 
                There is something magical about the 21 hairpins of Alpe d'Huez. Every turn tells a story of the Tour de France.

                <strong>The Strategy</strong><br>
                I decided to keep my heart rate in Zone 3 for the first half. It's easy to blow up your legs on the first steep ramps. 
                By the time I hit Dutch Corner (Turn 7), I had enough energy to push the pace.

                After the ride, I cooled down with a slow walk through the village. 
                Recovery is just as important as the effort itself. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And of course, while recovering, I managed to get a 3-star attack in our <strong>Clash of Clans</strong> war. 
                A perfect day of physical and mental strategy.
